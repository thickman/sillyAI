algorithm:

MACHINE
1. get an input (points)
2. create random weights for that points
3. activation function based on sum (a0w0 + a1w1 + ... + anwn) to determine the output

TRAINING PROCESS
1. get and input (points) with known correct output (answers) for them
2. produce (guess) output for given weights
3. compare given (guessed) output with correct output and calculate the error
4. use this error to correct weights (new weight = currentWeight + error * learningRate)


//update that
